### Problem Statement

There are plenty of Facebook groups that allow the Purdue community to exchange textbooks and other goods and services. However, these groups are often very messy, not user-friendly and inefficient when it comes to filtering results. For example, when a buyer wants to find a        particular textbook for a class, there is no way of filtering search results by a particular class or major. Even if a buyer manages to find a particular good that he or she is looking for, there might still be further dispute because of the price. To handle this mismatch in the Purdue marketplace, we decided to create a web-based application to provide a peer to peer trading place for students and faculty. Sellers will be able to set a price that allows a buyer to immediately purchase the good, or alternatively, buyers can bid for a good if they deem the immediate selling price too high. Once a deal between two parties is reached, they can meet somewhere on the Purdue campus and and make the exchange, effectively saving time and money on delivery costs.
