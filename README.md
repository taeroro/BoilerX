### Problem Statement

There are plenty of Facebook groups that allow the Purdue community to exchange textbooks and other goods and services. However, these groups are often very messy, not user-friendly and inefficient when it comes to filtering results. For example, when a buyer wants to find a        particular textbook for a class, there is no way of filtering search results by a particular class or major. Even if a buyer manages to find a particular good that he or she is looking for, there might still be further dispute because of the price. To handle this mismatch in the Purdue marketplace, we decided to create a web-based application to provide a peer to peer trading place for students and faculty. Sellers will be able to set a price that allows a buyer to immediately purchase the good, or alternatively, buyers can bid for a good if they deem the immediate selling price too high. Once a deal between two parties is reached, they can meet somewhere on the Purdue campus and and make the exchange, effectively saving time and money on delivery costs. 


### Objectives
* Build a website for the Purdue community to trade goods and services easily
* Allow users to search for products by names and keywords like class CRN
* Allow users to view products filtered by categories
* Allow sellers to set a starting bid price and/or an immediate selling price
* Allow users to keep track of products that they have placed bids on
* Allow users to see other usersâ€™ email and/or phone number only after a bid/deal is
made
* Allow users to see the most popular items for sale
* Allow users to rate buyers and/or sellers after they complete the trade


### Stakeholders
* Developers: Four group members
* Purdue Students
* Purdue Faculties
* Advertisers on our website


### Deliverables
* A website using ReactJS, Bootstrap, MongoDB, and NodeJS where users can sell and
buy used textbooks, school supplies, furnitures, clothings, etc.
* A trading marketplace where users can trade for goods and services easily.
* A database that can store user information, item information and transaction history.
* A server that can process a reasonable number of requests simultaneously
* An easy search and filter tool for Purdue students to look up goods and services. For
example, items can be filtered by category and textbooks can be filtered by course
name.
